# Reeborg's Hurdles Race Solver
## Overview
This repository contains a solution for the "Hurdles Race" world in the Reeborg's World challenge. The goal of this world is to guide Reeborg, the robot, through a predefined path, overcoming hurdles along the way. The project provides a solution script written in both Python and JavaScript that utilizes the Reeborg's World programming environment.

## World Description
- **World Layout:** The world is a race course with hurdles, and Reeborg starts at coordinates (1, 1).
- **Hurdles:** There are walls at specific locations representing hurdles that Reeborg needs to navigate around.
- **Goal:** Reeborg must reach the finish line at coordinates (13, 1), marked by a racing flag.

## Instructions
1. **Python Solution:**
  - The Python solution is available in the file named **'python_solution.py'**.
  - Run the Python script in the Reeborg's World environment to see Reeborg successfully complete the hurdles race.
2. **JavaScript Solution:**
  - The JavaScript solution is embedded in the world's **'onload'** and **'post'** sections.
  - Open the world in the Reeborg's World editor and execute the provided script.
  - Ensure that the correct path is followed, and the hurdles are overcome.
## Additional Information
- **World Difficulty:** This world is classified as "DIFFICULTY5."
- **Optimization:** For a more advanced solution, users are encouraged to define an advanced function named **'jump()'** to simplify the program.
